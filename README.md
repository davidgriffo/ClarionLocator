# ClarionLocator
Test the Clarion locator in a list


  An example of  :
   * filtering a list of records  
   * stepping through a list       
   * using the locator event ( the ? in the vcr) 
   * sorting on header
   
 this test was expanded to recieve notice from the user clicking on the locator button
 in the vcr.

  The EVENT:Locate will only work if you have imm set on the list.
  When you add the imm property you then have to do a lot of work 
  listening to all the other properties on the list.
